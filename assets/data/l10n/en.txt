aboutText = [Chinese doctrine of Yin and Yang is more than a thousand years. We all know that the black and white parts symbolize light and dark beginning of the universe. For a thousand years the sages of all nations and nationalities are trying to combine them for the sake of world harmony. And, nevertheless, there is no such person who managed to do this.]
aboutText2=[You, dear gamer, have a an opportunity to be the first who got such a combination. But, as expected, in Chinese philosophy, you will need to combine all the figures at the same time - the harmony is supposed to occur simultaneously in all corners of your field - the Earth.]

legend=[Times are changing.
But human history remains with us forever.
It happened thousands of years ago in the
crannies of the world. Then there lived 
a boy named Yinyang. He grew up in the shadow 
of spreading trees, tending cattle and watch the sunset.
And when time to be a young man came,
Yinyang went deep into the mountains to the most
wise warrior, who saved his village from 
the attack of the black demons many years ago. 
There were rumors that he won them alone, with only
sword in hand. To master the art of battle
Yinyang went to the brave old man, who was an old 
man by that time. The old man taught the boy for three years, three months and three days.
And then enemies came, and started to destroy 
everything in a mountain village, kill women
and children, and men who dared to raise against the
their weapons, brutally executed.
Yinyang heard the thunder of the terrible massacre, 
grabbed the sword of his teacher, and rushed to help
the inhabitants of his native village.]
legend2=[He fought with the enemies for
seven nights without sleep and rest. 
Killed hundreds but in their place came thousands.
And on the seventh day swarthy giant stood against 
the warrior Yinyang. They fought for seven years
Finally Yinyang looked into his face and froze in stupor.
He saw that all this time he fought against ... himself.
And every soldier of the enemy's army had his face.
So, that made this troop invincible.
And Yinyang realized how he could overcome this troop.
He drew his sword against himself and cut his body 
in half. Hordes of demons suddenly vanished into the 
air and Yinyang's body turned into parts. One part was 
white. It soared into the heavens. The second part was 
black. It sank into the ground. And ever since people
try to reunite them, revive the ancient knight
who guarded our world.
